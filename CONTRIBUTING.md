You are welcomed to contribute to this project. 

Code contributed to this project must either: 

1) Pass the progsbase analyzer or 
2) be regarded as support libraries to bridge the gap between progsbase code and non-progsbase libraries.

Code that passes the progsbase analyzer is limited to the scope of this project. Code that better fits a different library should be included in it instead.
